This repository contains the .ipynb files for assignments completed during my course titled "Probability, Statistics, and Data Visualization".

## Correlation
This code analyzes the Iris dataset by calculating the mean, variance, and correlation between attributes (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width). It ranks attribute pairs by correlation strength and visualizes them using scatter plots. The analysis is also broken down by species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) to highlight statistical differences.

## Data Exploration
This project analyzes ATP match data (2000-2024) through advanced data visualizations, exploring match trends, player performance, and correlations. It identifies top and least successful players per surface, visualizes BMI distributions with Gaussian curves, and showcases winner and loser distributions by weight and country. Key visualizations include series-wise match frequencies, year-wise match totals, and Rafael Nadal's dominance as the player with the most tournament wins.

## Dimensionality Reduction
This project performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the famous Iris dataset, reducing its dimensionality from four attributes to two and three dimensions for better visualization. The covariance matrix is computed for sepal and petal measurements, followed by the extraction of principal components, revealing key directions of variance in the data. Dimensionality reduction to two and three dimensions allows for effective visualization, with scatter plots highlighting the separation of species like Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Expectation PMF CDF
This Python code efficiently analyzes the joint probability mass function (PMF) of two discrete random variables. It begins by constructing a probability matrix which then calculates marginal probabilities to assess whether the variables are independent, printing the result accordingly. Additionally, it computes the expected values E[X] and E[Y] along with the joint expectation E[XY]. By centering the variables and calculating the covariance E[X1Y1], the code provides insights into the linear relationship between the two variables.

## Histogram Equalization Matching
This code performs image processing using OpenCV and Matplotlib, focusing on histogram equalization and intensity matching. It displays images alongside their normalized histograms (PDF) and cumulative histograms (CDF) and enhances contrast through histogram equalization. Additionally, it matches the intensity distributions of images using histogram matching techniques. Users can visualize both the original and equalized images along with their matched outputs and corresponding histograms, making it suitable for applications in image analysis.

## Image Binarization OTSU
This code utilizes OpenCV and Matplotlib for image processing tasks. It reads several images in grayscale, displays them alongside their normalized and cumulative histograms, and applies Otsu's thresholding method to separate the foreground and background. The code also includes functionality to generate and analyze noisy images by adding Gaussian noise, subsequently applying the same thresholding technique.

## PDF Continuous Random Variable
The provided code consists of various Python functions that visualize different probability distributions and their cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) using Matplotlib. Each function generates plots for specific distributions, such as uniform, Gaussian, exponential, Cauchy, Laplacian, Rayleigh, discrete uniform, and Bernoulli.

## Probability Distribution Discrete Time
The code defines functions to visualize various discrete probability distributions, including Discrete Uniform, Bernoulli, Binomial, Geometric, and Poisson distributions. Each function generates and plots the corresponding probabilities, allowing for easy comparison of different parameters.
